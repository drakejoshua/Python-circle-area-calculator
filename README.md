# Python circle area calculator

This is a python program used to calculate the area of a circle. Built with python 3 only

## Software Requirements
- python must be installed to run the program ( version 3+ )

## How to use?
1. To start using the program, firstly download the code( circleareacalculator.py ) as a ZIP archive from the github repo above or using the link: https://github.com/drakejoshua/Python-circle-area-calculator/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

2. After downloading, unzip the archive and extract the circleareacalculator.py from the archive. Then, navigate to the file location of the extracted file on your command line or in vs code and then run the program using the file

> *To run on the command line( command prompt or bash ), run the command:*
>> `C:\file_location>py circleareacalculator.py`
>> or
>> `~/file_location>py circleareacalculator.py`

> *if using visual studio code,*
>> just click 'run' in the menu bar and click 'run without debugging'. This should open up >> the CLI in the vscode window

3. After running, the program will prompt you for the radius of the circle( in centimeters ) for which you want to calculate it's area.

``` bash
This is a program designed by mabawonku joshua
This program is to be used to calculate the area of a circle
Enter the radius of the circle you want to calculate( in cm )_
```

4. Enter the radius in cm and the result will be displayed below the prompt:

``` bash
This is a program designed by mabawonku joshua
This program is to be used to calculate the area of a circle
Enter the radius of the circle you want to calculate( in cm )7
The area of the circle is 154 square centimeters
```

5. The program stops only after the result has been computed or if an error occured. If you want to re-compute the area of another circle, just re-run the program.
